Welcome to ReVEL's documentation!
=================================

ReVEL(Robust Evaluation VEctorized Loca-linear-explanation) is a Python
library that provides series of tools for Explinable Artificial Intelligence(XAI) 
from the perspective of the audition of black-box. Specifically, it provides 
a framework for the generation and evaluation of Local Linear Explanations(LLEs).

This library develops the framework proposed on the paper `REVEL Framework to Measure Local Linear Explanations for Black-Box Models: Deep Learning Image Classification Case Study <https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/8068569>`_. If you use this library in your research, please cite the paper as follows:
